# Semantic versioning

We recommend to use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) for your function:

* First release must use the 1.0.0 version, 
* The first digit is use for major updates and breaking changes, 
* The second digit is used for new features,
* The third digit is used for fixes.

It is also possible to release milestones (1.0.0-M1) or release candidates (1.0.0-RC1) for early integration in 
projects.
